Unreleased
**********

0.1.72 – 2026-09-21
*******************

* feat: make ``SAPSuccessFactorsEnterpriseCustomerConfiguration.is_valid`` aware of ``auth_type``,
  requiring a Client Secret for ``sap_signed_assertion`` customers and a parseable private key,
  assertion audience, and token endpoint path for ``self_signed_assertion`` customers, so migrated
  customers are no longer reported as ``INVALID_CONFIG``. Abort SAP transmission entry points before
  any request when required configuration is missing, naming the missing fields in the log and
  keeping sync-attempt timestamps moving so a broken configuration shows up as erroring now instead of
  going stale. ``EnterpriseCustomerPluginConfiguration`` gains an ``is_ready_to_transmit`` hook that
  passes everything through by default; SAP is the only channel that implements it, so every other
  channel keeps its current behaviour until it is overridden under its own ticket. Private key
  validation honours the configured
  ``decrypted_private_key_passphrase``, since a passphrase-protected key cannot be parsed without it.

0.1.71 – 2026-09-17
*******************

* feat: extend ``SAPSuccessFactorsEnterpriseCustomerConfiguration`` with an ``auth_type`` field
  (``sap_signed_assertion`` / ``self_signed_assertion``, defaulting to ``sap_signed_assertion``),
  encrypted-at-rest ``private_key`` and ``private_key_passphrase`` fields used to self-sign SAML
  bearer assertions, and a configurable SAML assertion ``audience``; adds ``saml_assertion_api_path``
  and ``oauth_token_api_path`` to ``SAPSuccessFactorsGlobalConfiguration``; in preparation for
  discontinuing use of the SAP OAuth IdP API. Self-signed assertion support is still under
  development and is not yet used to authenticate any transmissions.

0.1.70 – 2026-09-03
*******************

* feat: migrate Cornerstone learner data transmission from the launch-time completion callback to Cornerstone's
  Transcript API, authenticated with OAuth client credentials instead of the learner's session token; opt-in per
  customer via new encrypted ``client_id`` / ``client_secret`` config fields

0.1.69 – 2026-08-24
*******************

* feat: Register the new ``sync_tpa_budget_group`` pipeline step which syncs the logging-in
  learner's EnterpriseGroup membership to the Learner Credit budget group mapped to the
  EnterpriseCustomer for this active pipeline.

0.1.68 – 2026-08-20
*******************

* fix: gate SAP SF totalHours/creditHours behind a new dedicated ``transmit_course_hours``
  flag (defaults off), decoupled from the unrelated ``transmit_total_hours`` field, and strip
  them on delete too, fixing the 400 "unrecognised fields" error for non-ACG customers.

0.1.67 – 2026-08-05
*******************

* feat: add ``enterprise_group_uuid`` mapping to ``TpaOrgAllowlist``, linking an allowlisted org
  to its Learner Credit budget group
* feat: add login-time sync (``pipeline.sync_tpa_budget_group``) that places a learner into
  the budget group matching their org id, gated behind the ``enable_tpa_org_group_login_sync``
  waffle switch (default off, inert until enabled per the ENT-12084 rollout plan)
* refactor: promote org-id extraction from ``handlers.py`` into a shared
  ``tpa_org_id_service.get_tpa_org_id``, reused by both the webhook payload builder and the new
  login-time sync
